      <h2>General Terms and Conditions for using CONFETTI</h2>
      <p>
        In the following, you find the terms of use for the services of CONFETTI. Please respect also our extensive measures to protect privacy - we set a high value on the protection of personal data.
      </p>

      <h3>Preface</h3>

      <p>With the registration as a user of the CONFETTI platform you (hereinafter referred to as “user”) accept the following terms and conditions for the use of CONFETTI (hereinafter referred to as “terms”). CONFETTI operates its services under the top-level domains (getconfetti.com etc.), as well as various sub-domains and aliases of these domains. All websites on which CONFETTI provides its services are hereinafter referred to as “CONFETTI-websites”. These terms shall govern the contractual relationship between the user and CONFETTI, irrespective of which CONFETTI-website the user is registered with or logged on to. To use the services of CONFETTI the user must be of age.</p>

      <h3>1. Subject Matter</h3>

      <p>1.1. Registered users of the CONFETTI-websites are offered to organize meetings and events. CONFETTI reserves its right to charge a fee for specific services. If so, the user accepts his/her payment obligations for the use of these specific services by clicking on a special button offered in that case.</p>

      <p>1.2. Any use of the services and contents offered on the CONFETTI-websites beyond the scope of options provided by CONFETTI requires the prior written consent of CONFETTI.</p>

      <p>1.3. CONFETTI shall only make data and/or information provided by the user available for other uses provided that this data and/or information does not violate any laws or these terms. CONFETTI is entitled to remove any illegal or prohibited data and/or information from CONFETTI-websites without prior notice to the user.</p>

      <p>1.4. The user acknowledges and agrees that it is technically impossible to achieve 100% availability of the CONFETTI-websites. CONFETTI shall nonetheless endeavor to keep CONFETTI-websites available without interruption. Events related to maintenance, security or capacity requirements, and/or events beyond CONFETTI's control (e.g. disruptions in public communication networks, power failures etc.), may result in brief malfunctions or temporary interruptions of the services provided on CONFETTI-websites.</p>

      <p>1.5. CONFETTI merely provides the user with a platform on which to establish contact with other users, and only provides those technical applications that allow users to contact one another. As regards content, CONFETTI does not take part in any communication between users. If users enter into agreements with one another over CONFETTI-websites, CONFETTI shall not be a contracting party to these agreements. The users alone are responsible for the execution and/or fulfilment of agreements in which they enter with one another. CONFETTI shall not be held liable if users are unable to contact one another over CONFETTI-websites regarding such agreements. Furthermore, CONFETTI shall not be liable for breaches of duty in relation to agreements entered into between users.</p>



      <h3>2. Registration, Representations and Warranties upon Registration</h3>

      <p>2.1. The user warrants that all of the data provided by the user for registration is accurate.</p>

      <p>2.2. The user warrants that he or she is of legal age at the time of registration.</p>

      <p>2.3. The user shall choose a password upon registration. The user is obliged to keep this password secret. CONFETTI shall not disclose the password to any third party and CONFETTI shall not ask for the user's password at any time.</p>

      <p>2.4. Each user is entitled to register with CONFETTI only once, and the user may only establish one user profile.</p>

      <p>2.5. It is technically impossible for CONFETTI to determine with certainty whether any user registered with CONFETTI is in fact the person he or she represents to be. Therefore, CONFETTI assumes no liability for the actual identity of a user. Each user is solely responsible for checking the actual identity of another user.</p>



      <h3>3. Obligations of the user</h3>

      <p>3.1. The user is obliged,</p>

      <p>3.1.1. To provide only true and non-misleading statements in the user profile and in communications with other users.</p>

      <p>3.1.2. To comply with all applicable legislation, and respect all third-party rights. In Particular, the user shall not</p>

      <p>(v) use or promote any commercial practices considered unfair competition, including progressive customer acquisition practices (such as chain distribution systems, multilevel selling or pyramid sales).</p>

      <p>3.1.3. To refrain from engaging in any of the following annoying actions, even if they do not constitute a breach of any applicable laws: Sending chain letters; Performing, advertising and promoting any form of structural distribution measures (such as multi-level marketing or multi-level network marketing) or communicating in any insinuating or sexual way (suggestive or explicit).</p>

      <p>3.2. The user is prohibited from the following: Employing any mechanisms, software or scripts when using CONFETTI-websites. However, the user may use the interfaces or software provided by CONFETTI within the scope of the services available on the CONFETTI-websites. Blocking, overwriting, modifying and copying of any contents of the CONFETTI-websites, unless said actions are necessary for the proper use of the services on the CONFETTI-websites. For example, the use of the "Robot/Crawler" search engine technology is not required for proper use of the services, and is therefore prohibited. Distributing or publicly disclosing the contents of any of the CONFETTI-websites or any other user.

      <p>5.1. The user may terminate the membership at any time without cause. The user may deliver notice of termination using the contact form available on all CONFETTI-websites at any time.

      <p>5.2. CONFETTI has the right to terminate the membership of an user according to the legal requirements, in event on a good cause even without any period of notice. A good cause is defined as an event which makes it unacceptable for CONFETTI to continue the agreement to the end of the termination period, taking into account all circumstances of the individual case and weighing the interests of CONFETTI against the user's. A good cause includes any the following events: If the user fails to comply with any applicable legal provisions; If the user breaches a contractual obligation, in particular an obligation set forth in sections 2 and 3 of these terms; If the reputation of the services offered on the CONFETTI-websites is substantially impaired by the online-presence of the user (if, for example, it is discovered after registration that the user has been convicted of a criminal offence, and if said conviction is known to other users); If the user promotes any communities or associations (or any of their methods or activities) which are under surveillance by authorities responsible for public safety or the protection of minors, or; If the user causes harm to any other user(s).</p>

      <p>5.3. In the event of a good cause in accordance with section 5.2. and notwithstanding CONFETTI's right to terminate the contract in accordance with section 5.2., CONFETTI is entitled to: Delete the contents posted by the user; Issue a warning, or; Block the user's access to the services on the CONFETTI-websites.</p>

      <p>6.2. The user may report any activities of any other user which violate applicable laws and/or these terms using the contact form available at all CONFETTI-websites.</p>



      <h3>7. Liability of CONFETTI</h3>

      <p>Whatever the legal grounds, liability for damage claims based only on ordinary negligence against CONFETTI (including its vicarious agents) shall exist only if CONFETTI breaches a basic/cardinal obligation under this agreement.

      <h3>8. Indemnity</h3>

      <p>8.1 The user shall indemnify and exempt CONFETTI from all actions, including damage claims, asserted by other users or third parties against CONFETTI resulting from an infringement of their rights by the contents posted by the user on CONFETTI-websites.

The user assumes all reasonable costs CONFETTI incurs due to an infringement of third party rights, including all reasonable legal-defence costs. All other rights, including damage claims by CONFETTI, are hereby unaffected. The aforementioned obligations shall not apply to the extent the user is not responsible for the infringement.</p>

      <p>8.2 In the event the content posted by the user infringes any rights of any third party, the user shall, at its own expense and at CONFETTI's discretion, either obtain the right to use said contents or render said contents free of any infringement.

      <h3>10. Final Provisions</h3>

      <p>10.1. These terms and any amendments thereto must be in writing to be valid. No secondary agreements exist.</p>

      <p>10.2. CONFETTI reserves the right to amend these terms at any time, without giving reasons. CONFETTI shall give due notice of any amendments of these terms to the user. If the user does not object to the applicability of the revised terms within two (2) weeks after receipt of said notice, the amended terms shall be deemed to be accepted by the user. CONFETTI shall inform the user about the user's right to object and of the relevance of the objection deadline in said notice.</p>

      <p>10.3. Unless otherwise stated in these terms, the user may submit all notices to CONFETTI using the contact form provided on each of the CONFETTI-websites, or email. CONFETTI may send notices to the user by E-Mail or post to the addresses given in the user’s current contact data in his or her user account.</p>

      <p>10.4. If any provision of these terms is, for any reason, invalid and/or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. The parties agree to replace an invalid and/or unenforceable provision with a valid and/or enforceable provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid and/or unenforceable provision. This also applies to contractual loopholes.</p>

      <p>10.5. The place of performance under these terms shall be CONFETTI's main place of business.</p>

      <p>10.6. Place of jurisdiction, insofar as legally admissible, shall be the main place of business of CONFETTI.</p>

      <h2>General terms and conditions - Attende </h2>

      <p>In the following, you will find the General Terms and Conditions for the use of CONFETTI by attendees.</p>


      <h3>Preface</h3>
      <p>By purchasing a ticket on one of the websites provided by Confetti (“CONFETTI”), you (“attendee”) accept the following “General Terms and Conditions for the use of CONFETTI by Attendee” (“terms”). CONFETTI offers private and professional organisers (“organiser”) a web-based solution to organize events, meetings, conferences, virtual or similar events (“events”). Organisers can also register attendees, sell tickets, and allow invoicing over CONFETTI for these events. CONFETTI provides its services under various top-level domains as well as under various sub domains and aliases of these domains (“CONFETTI-Websites”). These terms shall govern the contractual relationship between the attendee, the organiser, and CONFETTI, irrespective of which CONFETTI-Websites the attendee uses. Only persons of age may use the services of CONFETTI.</p>


      <h3>1. Contracting parties, involvement of GTC for organisers </h3>
      <p>1.1. By purchasing a ticket or registering for an event on the CONFETTI-Websites, a sales contract is created solely between the relevant attendee and the relevant organiser regarding attendance at an event. CONFETTI itself is not the organiser, but rather handles the processing of ticket sales on the behalf of the organiser. CONFETTI is therefore not liable for organiser insolvency or for the failure of an event.</p>


      <p>1.2 It is possible that the organiser's own General Terms and Conditions may also apply for carrying out the event. CONFETTI has no influence over this. It is the duty of the attendee to inform himself about possible existing terms of the organiser before purchasing tickets.</p>
      <p>1.3. The attendee assures that they are of age at the time of registration, considering they are a actual or legal person.</p>


      <h3>2. Subject matter and conclusion of the contract</h3>
      <p>2.1. Information about events, amount of available tickets, ticket price and possible payment methods is only subject to guidelines specified by the organiser. CONFETTI has no influence regarding this information. It is the organiser’s duty to verify this information.</p>
      <p>2.2. The organiser, with the provided information in clause 2.1, provides an offer for the conclusion of the purchase contract. By making a purchase on CONFETTI or a Confetti-Website, the attendee accepts the offer for the conclusion of the purchase contract. In order to accept the offer, the attendee is required to have filled out all the necessary fields (marked with a “*”) and to have accepted these General Terms and Conditions. The attendee will receive a confirmation email immediately after the order and/or payment regarding the conclusion of the purchase contract. The attendee is required to inform CONFETTI if they do not receive this confirmation email on time.</p>
      <p>2.3. CONFETTI has the right to cancel the purchase contract (ex parte right of withdrawal) if the attendee has violated conditions of the pre sale, which have been stated by the organiser or CONFETTI. The declaration of withdrawal can also be provided implied by refunding the paid amounts.</p>


      <h3>3. Total price and payment arrangements</h3>
      <p>3.1. The total price for a ticket may exceed the stated ticket price. The price for a ticket is based on the price defined by the organiser. It will be displayed in the purchase process whether VAT is included or not. Depending on the agreement between CONFETTI and the organiser, the transaction fees for the ticket purchase will be added to the ticket price and displayed separately in the shopping cart at the time of order. Attendees pay all incurred international payment fees or exchange rate differences.</p>
      <p>3.2. The total price of the tickets including all fees is immediately due for payment upon receipt of the confirmation email.</p>
      <p>3.3. In case of payment via direct debit with insufficient credit bank balance, the attendee must indemnify CONFETTI from all costs. The attendee will be required to pay at least 10,- Euro for compensation. The attendee can however verify that CONFETTI sustained minor or no damages.</p>


      <p>3.4. Payments by direct debit will be collected by CONFETTI following a notice period of 6 working days. This deviates from the regular notice period of 14 days.</p>


      <h3>4. Ticket shipment, loss, and complaints</h3>
      <p>4.1. Immediately after receipt of payment or after ordering (only for purchase on account), CONFETTI shall send the ticket(s) to the attendee’s email specified at the time of order, except when otherwise stipulated (e.g. tickets will be held at the venue).</p>
      <p>4.2. It is the duty of the attendee to check the tickets after receipt and to organize a new and correct ticket if necessary.</p>
      <p>4.3. Attendees can re-request electronic tickets at any time. They can also be obtained in the “My Account” section, provided that the attendee has a user account on the CONFETTI-Websites.</p>


      <h3>5. Refund of tickets, refund of purchase price</h3>
      <p>In case of event cancellation or postponement, the attendee has the right to return a purchased ticket according to legal guidelines as well as according to the agreements made between the attendee and the organiser.  If CONFETTI is obliged to give an attendee a refund, CONFETTI will do so if the organiser of the event consents to it and if CONFETTI not already have transferred the money for the ticket/s to the organiser. </p>



      <h3>7. Liability and guarantee</h3>
      <p>Tripbirds is offered on an “as is” and “ as available” basis. This means that Tripbirds and it’s partners don’t give any representation, warranty, guarantee or any other form of comfort, express, implied or statutory, or make any representation regarding the information that we display on the site. Tripbirds and our partners hereby disclaim any and all implied warranties, including all implied warranties of merchantability, title, non-infringement or fitness for a specific purpose of the Tripbirds service.</p>
      <p>Under no circumstances will Tripbirds or any of our partners be liable for any claims arising from or relating to your use, or inability to use Tripbirds. This means any direct or indirect, incidental, punitive, exemplary, special or consequential damages or losses including: loss of profit, loss of goodwill, loss of claim, loss of data or wasted expenditure arising from or pursuant to any interruption, downtime (for maintenance, updates or otherwise), breakdown or non-availability of the Confetti service unless it breaches Swedish law.</p>



      <h3>8. Protection of privacy</h3>
      <p>By accepting these General Terms and Conditions the user also declares the following:</p>
      <p>I ALLOW MY PERSONAL ATTENDEE INFORMATION (FOR EXAMPLE NAME AND COMPANY) TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AND DISPLAYED ON THE ATTENDEE LIST FOR THE EVENT TO EVERYONE. I CAN HIDE THIS INFORMATION AFTER ORDERING OR REVOKE THIS APPROVAL AT ANY TIME BY WRITING AN EMAIL TO THE ORGANISER.</p>

      <h3>9. Final Provisions</h3>
      <p>9.1. Unless otherwise stated in these terms, the attendee may submit all notices to CONFETTI by email using the contact form provided on each of the CONFETTI-Websites, or by email. CONFETTI may send notices to the attendee by email to the address provided by the attendee at the time of order.</p>
      <p>9.2. For all ticket sales on the CONFETTI-Websites, only these terms shall apply between CONFETTI and the attendee. The attendee’s own terms and conditions shall not apply.</p>
      <p>9.3. Should any provision of these terms and conditions be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. The contracting parties are required to replace an invalid provision with a valid provision which in its regulatory content matches the intention and purpose of the invalid provision as closely as possible. This applies to contractual loopholes.</p>
      <p>9.4. Place of performance shall be CONFETTI headquarters in Sweden.</p>
      <p>9.5. Place of jurisdiction shall be CONFETTI headquarters in Sweden.</p>
      <p>9.6. Swedish law applies to the exclusion of private international law and to the Swedish law assumed UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.</p>
